* 🔄 Handle both tax-inclusive and tax-exclusive prices
* 📊 Detailed tax breakdown report
* 🛠️ Simple and intuitive API
* 💰 GHS currency formatting

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_taxcalculate: ^1.0.0
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_taxcalculate/flutter_taxcalculate.dart';

void main() {
  // Define your taxes
  final taxes = [
    Tax(name: 'VAT', rate: 0.15), // 15% VAT
    Tax(name: 'NHIL', rate: 0.025), // 2.5% NHIL
  ];

  // Calculate tax-exclusive price
  final result = TaxCalculator.calculateTotal(1000.0, taxes);
  
  // Calculate tax-inclusive price
  final inclusiveResult = TaxCalculator.calculateTotal(
    1000.0,
    taxes,
    isInclusive: true,
  );
}
```

### API Reference

#### Tax Class

```dart
class Tax {
  final String name;  // Name of the tax
  final double rate;  // Tax rate (e.g., 0.15 for 15%)
}
```

#### TaxCalculator Class

```dart
class TaxCalculator {
  // Calculate total with taxes
  static Map<String, dynamic> calculateTotal(
    double price,
    List<Tax> taxes, {
    bool isInclusive = false,
  });

  // Format amount as GHS currency
  static String formatCurrency(double amount);
}
```

The `calculateTotal` method returns a map with:
- `subtotal`: The original price
- `total`: The final price with all taxes
- `taxAmounts`: A map of tax names to their calculated amounts
